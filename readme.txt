The main "Blackjack Strategy Simulation" file contains 5 strategies for playing blackjack, and some stats for each strategy if the gambler plays 2,000,000 hands.

Each strategy has its own file as well, containing confidence intervals for 50,000 runs of 100 hands each.

I have also included the notebooks as .html files in the HTML Output zip file. This will contain all code and output saved.
