The main "Blackjack Strategy Simulation" file contains 5 strategies for playing blackjack, and some stats for each strategy if the gambler plays 2,000,000 hands.

Each strategy has its own file as well, containing confidence intervals for 50,000 runs of 100 hands each.

The Jupyter Notebook folder contains Jupyter Notebooks of each strategy.

For ease of reading if the user does not have a method of opening .ipynb files, I have also included the notebooks as .html files in the HTML Output folder. This will contain all code and output saved in an .html file.
